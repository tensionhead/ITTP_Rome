Python recognises the lines we want to form part of the loop body by the level of indentation and it is vital that you maintain consistent indentation throughout your programs. For example, you can choose to indent lines of code with spaces or with tabs but, whichever one you choose, you should only use one or the other for your whole program. Also, make sure that you keep the amount of indentation consistent across all the levels in your code. You will find that this approach makes your programs easier to read and understand, because you can see the structure of the program at a glance by the indentation."

Although you can use the command history at the shell prompt to access your previous lines of code, it is often easier to keep your scripting separate from the output.
